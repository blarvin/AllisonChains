A new user should be able to add LIKE INFORMATION to an existing doc with very low effort. This will require sophisticated algorithms. Instead of the doc originator adding complex INTERACTIONS for subsequent users to extend the work, the platform should have the sophistication to PARSE new info into the established categories and arrangements. So a new content adder can just drag and drop a favicon or a whole selection, or just a single image; and the doc's wizard will sort it out. If it needs some human input (which is a good thing), then it can ask. And it should highlight the new cells created, and take the user to each in turn to have the user confirm the automatic additions or make changes.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":779,"to":783}}}}],["107",{"pageContent":"V1.0 MLP: We can start that off by building the feature that automatically (intelligently) adds \"sort\" and \"filter\" interactions to certain docs.

If I want to create a new row with the info, I hover between cells to open a new row, and drop. If I think the info goes in a new or existing non-header cell, then again I can drop into an individual cell. Or hover to open a gap (creating a new column or new row of course). However I drop info in, there will be a bit of a dialogue to confirm it is parsed how I want it and put into the right places. If I use the drop target, that means I have the least confidence/want the most help. So in that case a modal window opens with the incoming info parsed/arranged by machine best guess. In this window I can easily drag/drop to rearrange and select/deselect options like 'create new row', thus correcting machine's best guess. I can also discard unwanted data from the info.

It makes it difficult for the platform to recommend related content and to recommend a simple path for creating focused content, because it may be very difficult to determine algorithmically what level of abstraction a user wishes to address. Basically, it would be nice, if the algorithms could determine the user's intent to produce one of three possible things: a #TRUNK, or a #FRUIT. Actually, everyone wants to make a fruit. But often they may be distracted into making several fruits and a branch.

From the app to the web and back: Crop a portion of any webpage and drop it back in the app. 2.) Emulate: build a reproduction of the cropped bit in pixel perfect HTML and CSS. 3.) Consolidate: take the emulated styles and apply them to a knode. 4.)
